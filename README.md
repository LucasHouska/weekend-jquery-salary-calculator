# Project Name: Lucas's Salary Calculanator 5000

## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

-I created inputs for all of the items needed and then made a submit button that, when clicked, would add the input values to an object in an array. I then took each value from the object 'employee' and appended it into a new table row, clearing the inputs and cost div, as well. Then I calculated the cost via a for loop. I wasn't sure if I could just use one 'cost' globally, but every time I tried, something was messed up. From here, I made a delete button, which, on click, takes the salary out of the total cost, empties the cost div, and then appends the new value. Then removes the respective row.
